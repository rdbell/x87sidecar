// fixup lists (`::operator new`). Both allocators land in *this* process, so
// we can't simply hand parent's pointers to Translator — the resulting
// pointers would be unreachable from the parent.
//
// Strategy:
//   1. Read parent's TR, ThreadContextOffsets, and IR array into locals.
//      sizeof(tr) bytes are read in full — the loader's M2 init patched
//      stock's TR allocator to allocate sizeof(TranslationResult) per TR
//      so parent's heap has the full extended struct (including our
//      appended x87_cache, OPT-1).
//   2. RESET TR's mutable buffers to empty (data=null, end=0, end_cap=0,
//      use_heap=1) and lists to nullptr. With use_heap=1 grow uses calloc
//      (no munmap of foreign pointers); with empty lists push_back_slow's
//      `delete old_begin` is `delete nullptr`, which is a no-op.
//   3. Run Translator on `tr`. Its growth/pushes allocate fresh sidecar-
//      local heap; the local TR's data/list pointers now name those.
//   4. APPEND the locally-produced bytes/fixups to parent's existing
//      buffers. If the append fits within parent's capacity we just
//      mach_vm_write the delta. If it doesn't, allocate a parent-side
//      replacement via `mach_vm_allocate`, copy parent's existing
//      contents over, then append the new tail. Update TR's pointers to
//      the parent VA.
//   5. mach_vm_write the patched TR back in full (sizeof(TranslationResult))
//      — including x87_cache so OPT-1's cross-instruction state persists.
//      Free our local allocations.
//
// Parent's old buffer (when we replace it on grow) becomes orphaned in
// parent's heap — we can't `free()` parent-side from here. The leak is
// per-grow only; capacity doubles each time so growths are logarithmic.

// ── OPT-1 cache storage (mode-independent) ──────────────────────────────────
// x87_cache is per-thread, cross-instruction Translator state. It used to be
// appended to the tracee's TranslationResult and round-tripped through the
// tracee's heap — which forced the M2 install to enlarge every TR (the TR-size
// MOVZ patch), and that patch is only safe before the first TR is allocated
// (pre-Rosetta-init). We now keep the cache HERE, keyed by the per-thread TR
// address the tracee passes in each request, so the tracee's TR stays
// stock-sized and no TR-size patch is needed. This is what lets the JIT-hook
// install work identically for default (task_for_pid+ptrace, stopped pre-init)
// and cooperative (task-port handshake, attached post-init) attach.
// Stock's real TranslationResult is 0x268 bytes — the size stock's own
// allocator MOVZ passes (offset_finder's translation_result_size_pattern; the
// AOT path patches this same MOVZ to 0x400 to make room for the appended
// x87_cache).  Our struct definition carries reverse-engineered tail fields
// past that (segments_*, field_280) up to offsetof(x87_cache)=0x288 — fields
// stock never allocates.  We read/write back exactly stock's real size: stock
// places each block's code buffer in the adjacent heap chunk (observed at
// tr+0x280), so writing even the extra bytes past 0x268 overran into and
// zeroed the block's first emitted ARM word — a 0x00000000 UDF that crashed
// WoW on nearly every fld block.  The translator only ever touches fields well
// below 0x268 (insn_buf, fixup lists, free_gpr/fpr masks, thread_context_
// offsets), so trimming to the real size loses no state.
