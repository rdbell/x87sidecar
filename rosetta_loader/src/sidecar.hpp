// Sidecar Mach IPC service.
//
// After the loader's debugger phase detaches, we transition into "sidecar
// mode": run a Mach receive loop alongside the kqueue NOTE_EXIT watch on
// the parent (wine) process. The receive loop accepts messages from the
// inline IPC stub installed in stock translate_insn and (for M2) discards
// them. M3 will add real translation work + reply.
namespace sidecar {

// Size of the TranslationResult stock allocates for a translation. Reads and
// writes of the tracee's TR are bounded by it (writing past it clobbered the
// adjacent heap chunk holding the block's first emitted ARM word).
constexpr size_t kStockTRSize = 0x268;

// Mach IPC port plumbing for the inline stub.
//
// Two ports are involved:
//   1. Service port: owned by us (loader/sidecar). Parent gets a SEND
//      right under `*outParentReqName`. Stub uses that name as the
//      msgh_remote_port of every translate_insn call.
//   2. Reply port: owned by parent. Allocated directly into parent's
//      namespace via mach_port_allocate(parentTaskPort, RECEIVE, ...).
//      Stub uses `*outParentReplyName` as msgh_local_port with
//      MAKE_SEND_ONCE so the kernel hands the sidecar a fresh
//      SEND_ONCE per call. Sidecar replies on that.
//
// `parentTaskPort` must be a send-right to the parent's task port (held
// by MuhDebugger.taskPort_). Returns true on success.

// Spawn a detached worker thread that runs the Mach receive loop on
// `servicePort`. The thread also needs `parentTaskPort` to
// mach_vm_read structs in the parent's address space (TranslationResult,
// IRInstr arrays). Returns true on success (thread started); the caller
// does NOT need to join it. The thread terminates implicitly on process
// exit.

// the same environment and would otherwise overwrite one another's profile.

// which thread it latched onto, the rate it actually achieved, the leaf
